Create a React Component that acts as a dropzone for the user to upload files.
 The user should be able to click to upload files or drag and drop files onto the component
 Once the user selects some files, the component should switch to show them an input for
Custodian and a submit button.
 When the user clicks submit, the component should show a progress bar indicating the
status of the files uploading. Actually uploading the files to a server is not required, but the
component should ‘Mock’ the time it takes for each file to upload so that the progress bar
shows progress.
 While files are uploading, the user should be able to drop in another set of files and enter
another Custodian name, allowing for multiple ‘batches’ of simultaneous uploads.
 Create the component using jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com or a similar utility so we can eaily read
the source code and view the final product
