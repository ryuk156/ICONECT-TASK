Create a React Component that acts as a dropzone for the user to upload files.

1. The user should be able to click to upload files or drag and drop files onto the component
2. Once the user selects some files, the component should switch to show them an input for
   Custodian and a submit button.
3. When the user clicks submit, the component should show a progress bar indicating the
   status of the files uploading. Actually uploading the files to a server is not required, but the
   component should ‘Mock’ the time it takes for each file to upload so that the progress bar
   shows progress.
4. While files are uploading, the user should be able to drop in another set of files and enter
   another Custodian name, allowing for multiple ‘batches’ of simultaneous uploads.
5. Create the component using jsfiddle.net, jsbin.com or a similar utility so we can eaily read
   the source code and view the final product
